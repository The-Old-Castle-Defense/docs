# Overview
_What is The Old Castle Defense?_

**The Old Castle Defense** is the fairest and most transparent play-to-earn (P2E) on-chain game, 
where players fight battles and sieges using their **Terrible Creatures** and **Knights of the Kingdom** 
NFTs and are rewarded with **$SPH** and **{{tt}}** tokens for victories. **Investors** are the third party of 
participants who can change the outcome of battles by investing in any of the teams, buying 
attacks, and saving NFTs from death. All funds from **Investors** are going to the treasury of both 
factions.

The winning **Faction** wins the treasury of the losing team. Winning **Faction Treasury** 
refunds back to **Investors** with rewards.

The game doesn't have timing. It's the on-chain game - it has blocks, where 1 block â‰ˆ {{bps}} sec.
