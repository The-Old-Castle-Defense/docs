# How to start playing
_There are two main types of players - Warriors (NFT owners) and 
Investors (Treasury Tokens holders)._

## Warriors (NFT owners)
If you are an NFT owner, you can play without any investments. You need to stake NFT 
in an active Siege, upgrade, and heal to increase abilities to earn more rewards than 
your teammates. Read more in [Game-Fi Elements](http://TBD.com).

**How to get NFT:** You can get NFT from Mystery Box. What is it and how to get it, read 
more in [Mystery Boxes](http://TBD.com).

## Investors ({{tt}} holders)
You can stake **{{tt}}** in the Faction's treasury pool and increase its attack power. 
The more and earlier you stake **{{tt}}**, the more reward you will receive once the 
Faction wins the Siege. Read more in [Investors](http://TBD.com).
