# Game-Fi Elements
_Only teamwork will lead the Faction to victory, so that the team does not break up, 
it is necessary to monitor the life and strength of the characters._

{% hint style="warning" %}
The game is built on a smart contract, so any burning of **$SPH** or investment of **{{tt}}** 
requires confirmation in the blockchain.
{% endhint %}

## Healing
After each Battle, the health level of the character drops by 11% of the maximum HP.

To restore 1% health, users must burn 1 Sapphire (**$SPH**).

It is better to restore a character's health in time, as each missing point of health 
reduces the attack power of the character by 1%.

### Formula
CurAttack * (CurHealth/MaxHealth),

where:
* **CurAttack** is current NFT attack;
* **CurHealth** is current NFT health;
* **MaxHealth** is maximum NFT health.

### Example

| HEALTH LEVEL (MAX = 100) | ATTACK |
|--------------------------|--------|
| 100                      | 10     |
| 89                       | 8,9    |
| 78                       | 6.942  |

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the health level of the character drops to 0, it is considered "fallen" and cannot 
participate in the current battle, unless it is revived.
{% endhint %}

## Revival
A Warrior or Investor may revive a dead character. The cost of one revival 
is **{{revival_cost}}** **{{tt}}**. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the **{{tt}}** 
invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your 
Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
{% endhint %}

## Level Up
Level up your NFT characters to increase strength, and compete with the opposing Faction, 
overpowering them and getting closer to achieving victory.

$SPH is required to level up a character. Each level increase lasts a certain number of 
blocks, which increases alongside the required amount of $SPH. This process can be 
accelerated using **{{tt}}** (Boost Level Up).

### Example

| TO LEVEL | BLOCKS | COST ($SPH) | COST TO BOOST ({{tt}}) |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1        | 60     | 10          | 1                      |
| 2        | 120    | 20          | 2                      |
| 3        | 180    | 30          | 3                      |
| n        | n * 60 | n * 10      | n                      |

{% hint style="warning" %}
The cost may vary depending on the exchange rate of Treasury Token (if it is not $USDT).

The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the **{{tt}}** 
invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your 
Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
{% endhint %}

When a character is leveled up, their attack power increases. The amount of attack increase 
is determined randomly between a certain range.

## Buying Faction Attacks
{% hint style="info" %}
If you use the Faction attack boost functionality, you become an Investor.
{% endhint %}

Investors can increase the faction's attack power in exchange for $MC, but each 
subsequent increase costs them more than the previous one.

Each boost adds a random number to the total attack power of the Faction within the 
range of the current boost level.

### Calculating the range of attack probability and cost

| LEVEL OF INCREAS | ATTACK INCREASE RANGE | COST ({{tt}}) |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 1                | 2 - 5                 | 10            |
| 2                | 3 - 6                 | 20            |
| 3                | 4 - 7                 | 30            |
| ...              | ...                   | ...           |
| 100              | 101 - 104             | 100           |
| ...              | ...                   | ...           |
| n                | (n + 1) "-" (n + 4)   | n * 10        |
