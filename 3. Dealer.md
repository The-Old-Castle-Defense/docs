# Dealer
_Do you need more Sapphires ($SPH)? The Dealer is here, send your {{tt}} and receive $SPH. 
But remember that he can invest the funds received in a way that will be beneficial to him._

{% hint style="warning" %}
Attention! The funds transferred to the dealer in exchange for Sapphires will be invested in the 
treasury of a random faction.
{% endhint %}

Players of the "Terrible Creatures" and "Knights Of The Kingdom" Factions can purchase 
Sapphires ($SPH) from the Dealer to level up their NFTs or heal them.

Sapphires are always sold at a fixed price: **1 $SPH = {{sph_cost}} {{tt}}**

{% hint style="warning" %}
The cost may vary depending on the exchange rate of Treasury Token (if it is not $USDT).

The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the **{{tt}}** 
invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your 
Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
