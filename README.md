# ⭐ Overview

**The Old Castle Defense** is the fairest and most transparent play-to-earn (P2E) on-chain game, where **players** fight battles and sieges using their **Terrible Creatures** and **Knights of the Kingdom** NFTs and are rewarded with **$SPH** and **$MC** tokens for victories. **Investors** are the third party of participants who can change the outcome of battles by investing in any of the teams, buying attacks, and saving NFTs from death. All funds from **investors** are going to the treasury of both **factions**.&#x20;

The winning **faction** wins the treasury of the losing team. Winning **faction** treasury refunds back to **investors** with rewards.

The game doesn't have timing. It's the on-chain game - it has blocks, where 1 block ≈ 5 sec.

{% hint style="info" %}
* **$SPH** - Game Utility token;
* **$MC** - Treasury coin;
* **Player -** a user that owns an NFT from Terrible Creatures or Knights of the Kingdom NFT collections.&#x20;
* **Factions -** Opposing sides: the Terrible Creatures versus the Knights of the Kingdom;

* **Beam Network 1 block-time \~ 15 seconds.**
* **The Siege -** the length of each entire game, approximately lasting 80,640 blocks (\~14 days);
