# ðŸ”¥ $FOMO Burn & BuyBack Program

<p>The methods of burning $FOMO work by creating a deflationary environment, reducing the supply of tokens over time while incentivizing players to hold $FOMO, 
and the token buyback allows for a stable price in the marketplace.</p>

## The Burn Mechanism: Reducing Supply to Increase Value
<div>

One of the core components of TOCD's strategy is the burning of $FOMO tokens. Burning permanently removes tokens from circulation, effectively reducing the total 
supply and creating scarcity, which often leads to an increase in the token's value.

* **For NFT Holders:** Players can burn $FOMO tokens instead of SPH (Sapphires) to increase their share of the in-game rewards. This system allows NFT holders to 
strategically use $FOMO, not only to gain in-game benefits but also to support the deflationary mechanics of the token, ensuring it retains long-term value. 
By burning $FOMO, they contribute to the tokenâ€™s scarcity and enhance the overall value of their holdings.

* **For Investors (non-NFT players):** When they buy an attack power for one of the factions (knights or creatures) during gameplay, 6% of their transaction amount is a fee, 
a portion of this fee is sent to burn. In this way, each in-game transaction helps reduce the total amount of $FOMO, benefiting the entire community and increasing the value of the token.

## The Buyback Strategy: Supporting Market Stability

TOCD also incorporates a buyback mechanism to enhance the value of the $FOMO token. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Revenue generation and buyback: TOCD generates revenue through transaction fees from transactions within the game. A portion of this revenue is used to purchase $FOMO tokens in the marketplace. 
This approach helps reduce selling pressure, creating a more stable market for $FOMO.

## Statistics on $FOMO Burns and Buybacks
<div>

As of now, over 40% of the total $FOMO supply has been burned. This substantial reduction has already had a positive impact on the tokenâ€™s market performance. 
In addition, the game continues to burn $FOMO through every transaction, further supporting the tokenâ€™s long-term value.

## How Players Benefit from the $FOMO Burn and Buyback Mechanism
<div>

The combination of burning $FOMO and buying back tokens creates a strong deflationary environment within the TOCD ecosystem. This mechanism not only helps stabilize the 
tokenâ€™s value but also provides ongoing benefits to players and investors alike. Whether youâ€™re an NFT holder looking to boost your in-game rewards or a player interested 
in increasing your $FOMO holdings, the burn and buyback strategy ensures that youâ€™re part of a sustainable, growing economy.
