# ðŸ‘¨ðŸŒ¾ Dealer

Players of the "Terrible Creatures" and "Knights Of The Kingdom" Factions can purchase Sapphires (**$SPH**) from the Dealer to level up their NFTs or heal them.

Sapphires are always sold at a fixed price:

**1 $SPH = 0.22 $MC**

{% hint style="warning" %}
The cost may vary depending on the exchange rate of $MC.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Attention! The funds transferred to the dealer in exchange for Sapphires will be invested in the treasury of a random faction.
{% endhint %}
