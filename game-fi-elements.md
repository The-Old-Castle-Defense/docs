# üéØ Game-Fi Elements

<p>Only teamwork will lead the Faction to victory, so that the team does not 
break up, it is necessary to monitor the life and strength of the characters.</p>

::card_warning
The game is built on a smart contract, so any burning of **$SPH** or investment of **${token}** 
requires confirmation in the blockchain.
::

## Healing
<div>

After each Battle, the health level of the character drops by 11% of the maximum HP.
</div>

<div>

To restore 1% health, users must burn 1 Sapphire (**$SPH**).
</div>

<div>

It is better to restore a character's health in time, as each missing point of health 
reduces the attack power of the character by 1%.
</div>

### The formula for reducing attack depending on health

::card_formula
::formula
<MathFormula formula="NewAttack=(CurHealth*CurAttack)/MaxHealth)" />,
::
where:
* **NewAttack** is NFT attack after the Battle;
* **CurHealth** is current NFT health (everytime after the Battle: MaxHealth - 11;
* **CurAttack** is current NFT attack at the time of the Battle;
* **MaxHealth** is maximum NFT health.
::

### Example

<table class="docs-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>HEALTH LEVEL (MAX = 100)</th>
      <th>ATTACK</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>89</td>
      <td>8.9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>78</td>
      <td>6.942</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

::card_warning
If the health level of the character drops to 0, it is considered "fallen" and cannot participate in the 
current battle, unless it is revived.
::

## Revival

Investors can revive deceased NFT characters. The cost of each revival is calculated by 
the formula.

### The formula for calculating the cost of revival

::card_formula
::formula
<MathFormula formula="RevCost=LVL+1" />,
::
where:
* **RevCost** is the cost of reviving in ${token};
* **LVL** is the level of NFT at the time of death.
::

::card_warning
The cost may vary depending on the exchange rate of Treasury Token (if it is not $USDT).\
The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the **${token}** 
invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your 
Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
::

## Level Up

<div>

Level up your NFT characters to increase strength, and compete with the opposing Faction, 
overpowering them and getting closer to achieving victory.
</div>

<div>

$SPH is required to level up a character. Each level increase lasts a certain number of 
blocks, which increases alongside the required amount of $SPH. This process can be 
accelerated using **${token}** (Boost Level Up).
</div>

<table class="docs-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>TO LEVEL</th>
      <th>BLOCKS</th>
      <th>COST ($SPH)</th>
      <th>COST TO BOOST ({token})</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>60</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>120</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>180</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>n</td>
      <td>n * 60</td>
      <td>n * 10</td>
      <td>n</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

::card_warning
The cost may vary depending on the exchange rate of Treasury Token (if it is not $USDT).\
The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the **${token}** 
invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your 
Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
::

When a character is leveled up, their attack power increases. The amount of attack increase 
is determined randomly between a certain range.

## Boosting Level Up

<div>

Skips the waiting time before the NFT level is raised.
</div>

::card_info
If you use the Faction attack boost functionality, you become an Investor.
::

## Burning of sapphires

<div>

To increase their share of the treasury, NFT owners can burn Sapphires. This increases their coefficient 
when calculating the reward at the end of the Siege. Read more about the calculation in the section:

<a href="rewards-after-the-siege.md" 
 class="docs-item">
<span>‚öîÔ∏è</span>
Rewards After The Siege</a>
</div>

## Increasing the Faction's attack

<div>

Investors can increase the faction's attack power in exchange for **${token}**, but each 
subsequent increase costs them more than the previous one.
</div>

<div>

Each boost adds a random number to the total attack power of the Faction within the 
range of the current boost level.
</div>

### Calculating the range of attack probability and cost

<table class="docs-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>LEVEL OF INCREASE</th>
      <th>ATTACK INCREASE RANGE</th>
      <th>COST ({token})</th>
