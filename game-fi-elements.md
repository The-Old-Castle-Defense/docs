# ðŸŽ¯ Game-Fi Elements

{% hint style="warning" %}
The game is built on a smart contract, so any burning of **$SPH** or investment of **$MC** requires confirmation.
{% endhint %}

## Healing

After each Battle, the health level of the character drops by 11% of the maximum HP.

To restore 1% health, users must burn 1 sapphire (**$SPH**).

It is better to restore a character's health in time, as each missing point of health reduces the attack power of the character by 1%.

Example:

<table><thead><tr><th width="205">Health level</th><th width="246">Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>100/100</td><td>150 (maximum at the current level)</td></tr><tr><td>90/100</td><td>135 [-10%]</td></tr><tr><td>10/100</td><td>15</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the health level of the character drops to 0, it is considered "fallen" and cannot participate in the current battle, unless it is revived.
{% endhint %}

## Revival

A Player or Investor may revive a dead character. The cost of one revival is 20 **$MC**.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the $**MC** invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
{% endhint %}

## **Level Up**

Level up your NFT characters to increase strength, and compete with the opposing Faction, overpowering them and getting closer to achieving victory.

**$SPH** is required to level up a character. Each level increase lasts a certain number of blocks, which increases alongside the required amount of **$SPH**. This process can be accelerated using **$MC**.

When a character is leveled up, their attack power increases. The amount of attack increase is determined randomly between a certain range (explained below).

<table><thead><tr><th width="104">Level</th><th width="143">Blocks</th><th width="155">Price ($SPH)</th><th width="213">Price For Boost ($MC)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>60</td><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>120</td><td>20</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>180</td><td>30</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>240</td><td>40</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>(n+1)*60</td><td>(n+1) * 10</td><td>2n+2</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The cost may vary depending on the exchange rate of $MC.

The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the $**MC** invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
{% endhint %}

## Buying Faction Attacks

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you use the Faction attack boost functionality, you become an Investor.
{% endhint %}

Investors can increase the faction's attack power in exchange for **$MC**, but each subsequent increase costs them more than the previous one.

Each boost adds a random number to the total attack power of the Faction within the range of the current boost level.

Calculating the range of attack probability and cost:

<table><thead><tr><th width="253">Number of level increases</th><th width="337">Attack Power Increase Range</th><th>Cost ($MC)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>2 - 5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3 - 6</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4 - 7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5 - 8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6 - 9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>101 - 104</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>(n+1) "-" (n+4)</td><td>2n</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The cost may vary depending on the exchange rate of $MC.

The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the **$MC** invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
