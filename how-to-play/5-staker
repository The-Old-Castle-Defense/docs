# Investor - ${token} Staker
- Token owners can stake ${token} in both Factions during the Siege, which allows them to protect themselves from a significant loss of funds in case of a loss. At the end of the Siege, the total amount of ${token} staked into the winning Faction is returned to the stakers along with a share of the treasury of the losing Faction, which amounts to 70% of the total.
