## About The Old Castle Defense
<div>

The Old Castle Defense (TOCD) is a gamified platform for NFT and **${token}** staking. TOCD is decentralized and operates on smart contracts.
</div>

<div>

A game session (Siege) is divided into rounds (Battles). During a Siege, two Factions compete: The Knights of The Kingdom and The Terrible 
Creatures. Users stake **${token}**, heal, and enhance staked NFTs to increase the attack power of the two opposing Factions. Staked ${token} 
are placed in the Faction's treasury and are the reward for the winner of the Siege.
</div>

<div>

The Faction with the higher attack is declared the 
winner at the end of the Battle and earns a victory point. 
</div>

<div>

The winner of the Siege is the Faction that has won more Battles than its 
opponent. The winning Faction receives all the **${token}** staked by the losing side and returns its own staked **${token}**.
