# ðŸš€ How to start playing on Beam Testnet with NFT or $MC - treasury token.

## NFT owners

If you are an NFT owner, you can play without any investments. You need to stake NFT in an active Siege, upgrade, and heal to increase abilities to earn more rewards than your teammates. Read more in [Game-Fi Elements](game-fi-elements.md).

## $MC holders

If you are not an NFT owner, but you have **$MC**. You can stake **$MC** in the Faction's treasury pool and increase its attack power. The more and earlier you stake **$MC**, the more reward you will receive once the Faction wins the Siege. Read more [Investors page](investors.md).&#x20;
