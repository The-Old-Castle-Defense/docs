# ðŸš€ How to start playing

<p>There are two main types of players - Warriors (NFT owners) and Investors (Treasury Tokens holders).</p>

## Warriors (NFT owners)

If you are an NFT owner, you can play without any investments. You need to stake NFT 
in an active Siege, upgrade, and heal to increase abilities to earn more rewards than 
your teammates. Read more in <a href="game-fi-elements.md" class="doc-link">Game-Fi Elements</a>.
