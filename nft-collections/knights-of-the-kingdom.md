> _The villagers living around the Old Castle are afraid, whispering scary tales of 
> frightening Terrible Creatures coming out of their lair, located in the mountains. 
Some suggest that the Terrible Creatures are related to the apocalypse, believing the 
> world will turn into a barren desert, while others believe the monsters simply hate 
> people. In recent times, many people have moved closer to the mountains to work in the 
> king's sapphire mines. (the King pays the miners well)
Sensing that his youthhood fairy tale may soon turn into a reality, the King has decreed 
> that his best Knights of the Kingdom defend the Old Castle, its sapphire treasury, and 
> the common folk. Decorated warriors, valiant brave men, and distinguished knights enter 
> the service of the King._ 
>
> _There will be a battle soon ‚Äì a ruthless battle between ancient magic, brave hearts and 
> merciless blades._
