> frightening Terrible Creatures coming out of their lair, located in the mountains. 
Some suggest that the Terrible Creatures are related to the apocalypse, believing the

> people. In recent times, many people have moved closer to the mountains to work in the 
> king's sapphire mines. (the King pays the miners well)
Sensing that his youthhood fairy tale may soon turn into a reality, the King has decreed
