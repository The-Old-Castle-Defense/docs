## Benefits of OG NFT

<div>

OG NFTs stand as beacons of distinction, offering exclusive advantages on the Base blockchain to their esteemed holders
</div>

<div>

* **OG Status Label:** As everyone can see TOCD Studio is a Community Driven and we want to know who helped us bring our
products to the masses as we can‚Äôt make it alone ‚Äî we make it with OGs and our loyal Community;
* **Revenue Share:** TOCD Studio distributes 20% of generated fees among OG NFT owners based on their stake value to have
a fair play to let earn more those who contributed more;
* **TOCD NFT Airdrop:** Every day we have an NFT Airdrop that allows users to Stake, Play, and Earn for free. You don‚Äôt
need to have anything except NFT. TOCD NFT (Knights or Creatures) earns 30% of the TVL of the opposite team. It‚Äôs a very nice reward, our community loves it!
* **And Many more:** OG is a part of the TOCD Studio on the Base blockchain, once you have it, you will get more benefits!

## Total Supply of OG NFTs

<div>

The total supply is 127 NFTs which are distributed to users for active participation in Farcaster‚Äôs Frame events. 
Only 127 NFT and no more will be in supply. Ownership of the OG TOCD NFT will be renounced (transferred to 0x000 address).
</div>

<div>

We are very excited to see how the community trades their OG TOCD NFT. For us, OG title means owning OG.

## Calculation of rewards for OG NFT owners

<div>

After each Siege, OG TOCD NFT holder will receive their rewards automatically. TOCD sends 20% of the collected fees to OG NFT. 
Each of your stakes of a token is calculated as a coefficient and added to the total user weight coefficient.
Each OG NFT is 1 share of the reward. But only those OG NFT owners who staked in the Siege participate in the distribution, regardless of the amount.
</div>

<div>

### Example:
* Alice has 5 OG NFT and she made a minimum stake (30 $DEGEN);
* Bob has 10 OG NFT, but he didn't place a bet;
* There are only 100 OG NFT Owners who staked;
**At the end of the Siege:**
* Alice will receive 5/100 (5%) of the 20% of the collected TOCD fees;
* Bob, unfortunately, won't get anything.
