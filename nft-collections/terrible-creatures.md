> _From the manuscripts found in the great library located in the Old Castle: 
Since our world was created, ancient beings have always lived in the great underground 
> realms. No one knows exactly where this underground realm is located or where its 
> entrance remains. 
It is said the entrance leads to a gigantically majestic hall, glistening with gold and 
> marbled with  precious gemstones. The walls of the hall are laid with beautiful minerals, 
> Magic Sapphires, the source of life for these ancient beings._

> _While in his youth and yet still a prince, the King read a story about the kingdoms of 
> the deep. The story amazed and fascinated him. The king surely did not believe in ancient 
> tales of Terrible Creatures. Yet he understood there could always be grains of truth, 
> that could be extracted from every old fairy tale. 
Therefore, he signed a royal order to begin the excavation of mines and caves across the 
> kingdom, in search of the fabled sapphires.
Several generations of miners ventured out into the mines believing they were destined to 
> find the king's highly-sought treasures. Many died or succumbed to disease, in search of 
> the precious mineral. Finally, the sapphires were found in a mine located near the wet 
> swamps shrouded in tall trees that enveloped any trace of sunlight. The sapphires were 
> extracted with such pace and insatiable greed, that within a few years, the mines eventually 
> became dry. As a result, the miners started digging deeper holes to satisfy the king's 
> demand for more sapphires._

> _Until the patience of the Terrible Creatures came to an end...
Sapphires have been a source of life and strength for the Terrible Creatures, since the 
> world was created. Without the sapphires, their species will not survive, so they are 
> crossing over to the surface to regain the stolen sapphires._
