> From the manuscripts found in the great library located in the Old Castle:&#x20;
>
> _Since our world was created, ancient beings have always lived in the great underground realms. No one knows exactly where this underground realm is located or where its entrance remains._&#x20;
>
> _It is said the entrance leads to a gigantically majestic hall, glistening with gold and marbled with  precious gemstones. The walls of the hall are laid with beautiful minerals, Magic Sapphires, the source of life for these ancient beings._

> _While in his youth and yet still a prince, the King read a story about the kingdoms of the deep. The story amazed and fascinated him. The king surely did not believe in ancient tales of Terrible Creatures. Yet he understood there could always be grains of truth, that could be extracted from every old fairy tale._&#x20;
>
> _Therefore, he signed a royal order to begin the excavation of mines and caves across the kingdom, in search of the fabled sapphires._
>
> _Several generations of miners ventured out into the mines believing they were destined to find the king's highly-sought treasures. Many died or succumbed to disease, in search of the precious mineral. Finally, the sapphires were found in a mine located near the wet swamps shrouded in tall trees that enveloped any trace of sunlight. The sapphires were extracted with such pace and insatiable greed, that within a few years, the mines eventually became dry. As a result, the miners started digging deeper holes to satisfy the king's demand for more sapphires._

> Until the patience of the Terrible Creatures came to an end...

> Sapphires have been a source of life and strength for the Terrible Creatures_,_ since the world was created. Without the sapphires, their species will not survive, so they are crossing over to the surface to regain the stolen sapphires.
