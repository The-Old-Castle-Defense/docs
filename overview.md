<p>What is The Old Castle Defense?</p>

# ⭐ Overview

**The Old Castle Defense** is a GameFi & DEFI platform with a revolutionary short-term, high-yield **${token}** & NFT 
staking system. Staking occurs during the game session (Siege). By upgrading NFTs and staking **${token}**, users 
increase their Faction's attack strength, with all funds pooled into the Faction's Treasury. The faction 
with the highest attack wins Battles and the Siege. Victorious users reclaim their staked funds and share 
the defeated Faction's treasury among themselves.

The winning **Faction** wins the treasury of the losing team. Winning **Faction Treasury** 
refunds back to **Investors** with rewards.

The game doesn't have timing. It's the on-chain game - it has blocks, where 1 block ≈ {bps} sec.
