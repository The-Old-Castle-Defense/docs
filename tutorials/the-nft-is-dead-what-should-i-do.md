# The NFT is dead, what should I do?

Click on the button with the image of the first aid kit, to the right of the amount of health of the NFT:

A confirmation window will appear. The cost of one rebirth is 10 **$MC**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The price includes a service commission of 6%. After deducting the commission, the **$MC** invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your Faction, the invested funds will be returned and a reward will be awarded.
{% endhint %}

Owners of dead NFTs, as well as living ones, receive rewards at the end of Battles and at the end of the Siege (game), depending on the maximum number of attacks of the NFT.
