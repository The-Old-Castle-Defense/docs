The cost of each revival is calculated by the formula:

::card_formula
::formula
<MathFormula formula="RevCost=LVL+1"/>,
::
where:
* **RevCost**: the cost of reviving in ${token};
* **LVL**: the level of NFT at the time of death.
::
</div>

::card_warning
The cost may vary depending on the exchange rate of Treasury Token (if it is not $USDT).\
The price includes a service fee of 6%. After the commission is deducted, the **{token}** 
invested by the participants is collected in the treasury. After the victory of your 
Faction, the invested funds will be returned and rewards will be distributed.
